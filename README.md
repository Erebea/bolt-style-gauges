# todo
Better icons

A bloat timer that isn't a mess and hopefully accurate

Temporal Anomaly procs, playing a sound and hilighting the ability

Cooldown tracking that looks nice

Soulfire and possibly other bleed reset procs

FSOA tracking

95/99 prayer indicator as a treat

overload indicator cause why not

Ranged gauge, I don't use ranged lmao
